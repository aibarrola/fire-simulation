# Fire Simulator 
### Visualize fire spread based on wind speed

__Context__: A project from the Hack the Math Hackathon. During the time, California has 30+ fires. I wanted to create a simulation to describe how fires spread depending on the wind speed.

__Requirements__:
1) You must use Javascript
2) You must deploy your project to the web
3) You must provide your source code
4) This hackathon is a solo hackathon. 


## How it works: 
1) Start a fire with any coordinates
2) Adjust wind speed
3) Start fires at random coordinates
